Problem 1 – Algebra / Linear Equations

Problem:
A company produces two products, A and B. Product A requires 2 hours of labor and 3 kg of raw material per unit. Product B requires 1 hour of labor and 4 kg of raw material per unit. The company has 100 hours of labor and 180 kg of raw material available. How many units of A and B can the company produce if they want to maximize production without exceeding resources?

Step-by-Step Solution:

Let 
x= units of A, 
y= units of B.

Constraints based on labor: 
2x+1y≤100
Constraints based on material: 
3x+4y≤180
Objective: maximize total production 
P=x+y
Solve constraints as equalities to find possible solutions:
From labor: 
y=100−2x
Substitute into material: 
3x+4(100−2x)≤180
3x+400−8x≤180
−5x+400≤180
−5x≤−220
x≥44
Check material constraint for 
x=44:
3(44)+4y≤180⇒132+4y≤180⇒4y≤48⇒y≤12
Check labor constraint for 
x=44:
2(44)+y≤100⇒88+y≤100⇒y≤12
Answer: Produce 44 units of A and 12 units of B to maximize production.

Problem 2 – Calculus / Optimization

Problem:
A farmer wants to build a rectangular pen along a river, so one side does not require fencing. The farmer has 120 meters of fencing. What dimensions maximize the area?
Step-by-Step Solution:

Let 
x= length along the river, 
y= width perpendicular to the river.
Fencing needed: 
x+2y=120⇒x=120−2y
Area 
A=x⋅y=(120−2y)y=120y−2y
2
Maximize area: take derivative 
(y)=120−4y
Set derivative to zero: 
120−4y=0⇒y=30
Find  x=120−2(30)=60
Answer: The dimensions that maximize area are length = 60 m (along river) and width = 30 m.

Problem 3 – Probability

Problem:
A bag contains 5 red balls, 3 blue balls, and 2 green balls. Two balls are drawn without replacement. What is the probability that both balls are red?
Step-by-Step Solution:
Total balls = 
5+3+2=10
Probability first ball is red: 
5/10=1/2
After removing one red ball, remaining balls = 9, red balls = 4
Probability second ball is red: 
4/9
Probability both are red = 
(1/2)⋅(4/9)=4/18=2/9
Answer: Probability = 2/9
